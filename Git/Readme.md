## What is Source Code Management?

Source Code Management (SCM) is the systematic process of tracking, controlling, and managing changes to software code. It not only enables teams to collaborate seamlessly but also preserves the entire history of a project's evolution. SCM is fundamental for modern software development, ensuring that codebases remain stable, traceable, and adaptable over time.

SCM involves a series of best practices and tools that allow developers to:
- **Track Changes:** Every alteration to the code, along with the author and an accompanying explanation, is recorded. This detailed tracking simplifies debugging and empowers teams to revert to previous stable versions when necessary.
- **Enhance Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on different parts of the code simultaneously without interfering with each other‚Äôs progress. Merging changes and resolving conflicts become efficient and streamlined.
- **Maintain History:** A comprehensive history of changes provides invaluable insights into the project's development, serving as both a record for troubleshooting and a learning resource.
- **Support Rollbacks:** If a newly introduced change causes issues, SCM makes it possible to quickly revert to a previous, working version without dramatic setbacks.


## How Was Source Code Managed Before Modern Version Control Systems

Before dedicated version control systems became the industry standard, managing source code was largely a manual process. Here are the key practices that shaped early SCM approaches:

### Manual File Duplication & Naming Conventions
- **Method:** Developers often saved each iteration of a file as a distinct copy with names like `project_v1`, `project_v2`, etc.
- **Challenge:** While this method captured changes, it became cumbersome and increased the chance for human error. Tracking the evolution of files and identifying which version contained specific modifications was a significant challenge.

### Manual Change Logs
- **Method:** Changes were documented manually in separate text files or logs. This log recorded what had been updated, why the change was made, and who introduced it.
- **Challenge:** Maintaining these logs required extra effort, and discrepancies between the log and actual file changes were common, reducing the reliability of the change history.

### Offline Archives and Physical Printouts
- **Method:** Some developers printed out code or stored codebases on external media for backup purposes.
- **Challenge:** This approach was not only inefficient but also made it difficult to synchronize changes, collaborate with others, or quickly revert to previous versions.

### Early Scripting and Utility Tools
- **Method:** Tools like `diff` and `patch` were used to compare file versions manually and attempt automated merging.
- **Challenge:** Although innovative for their time, these solutions required a deep technical understanding and still left much to be desired when dealing with complex, concurrent changes.

These early practices highlighted the limitations in scalability and reliability, eventually paving the way for the emergence of automated version control systems.



## What is a Version Control System?

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is software designed to help developers manage changes to source code over time. Its key functionalities include:

- **Change Tracking:** Every modification is logged with metadata detailing who made the change, when it was made, and why. This detailed history is essential for debugging and accountability.
  
- **Branching and Merging:** Developers can experiment with new features in isolated branches. When the work is complete, these changes are merged back into the main codebase, ensuring a smooth integration process.
  
- **Collaboration:** Multiple contributors can work on a single project concurrently. VCS handles complex scenarios like merging simultaneous changes, greatly reducing the risk of conflicts.
  
- **Version History:** A complete historical record allows for rollbacks to previous states, provides context for changes, and facilitates auditing.

By encapsulating these capabilities, VCS not only safeguards the integrity of the project but also empowers developers to innovate rapidly while minimizing risk.


##  History of Version Control Systems

The evolution of version control mirrors the growing complexity of software development. Here‚Äôs how we arrived at the systems we rely on today.

### Pre-VCS Era: Manual Versioning

Before dedicated version control systems emerged:
  
- **File Duplication:** Developers managed changes by saving multiple copies of files (e.g., `file_v1.txt`, `file_v2.txt`). This was prone to human error, confusion, and lost changes.
- **Manual Logs:** Change records were maintained in separate documents, making it hard to ensure consistency or retrieve precise historical data.

These methods were inefficient and error-prone, highlighting the need for a more systematic approach to managing code changes.

### Early VCS: SCCS and RCS

The first generation of VCS solutions provided automated ways to track changes:
  
- **Source Code Control System (SCCS):** Introduced in the 1970s, SCCS offered the first systematic method for tracking modifications, although it was limited in its ability to manage multiple files in a project.
- **Revision Control System (RCS):** Building on SCCS, RCS provided the "check-out" and "check-in" workflow, allowing for more efficient management of individual file revisions in Unix environments.

These systems laid the groundwork for automated version tracking, although they focused mostly on single-file versioning.

### Centralized Version Control Systems

As projects grew, so did the need for more robust solutions:
  
- **Concurrent Versions System (CVS):** Developed in the 1990s, CVS introduced a centralized repository concept. It permitted multiple developers to work simultaneously on a single codebase but had limitations with branching and non-linear development.
- **Subversion (SVN):** Emerging in the early 2000s, SVN improved upon CVS by offering better support for branching, merging, and managing binary files, addressing some of the shortcomings of its predecessor.

These centralized systems provided a more structured approach but were still inherently limited by their reliance on a single central repository.

### Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)

The next major evolution came with distributed systems, which fundamentally restructured how developers work:
  
- **Git:** Launched in 2005 by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development, Git revolutionized version control by allowing each developer to maintain a complete copy of the repository locally. This decentralized model supports robust branching and merging, enabling high-performance workflows.
- **Mercurial and Bazaar:** Other DVCS tools emerged to offer alternative workflows and user experiences, but Git quickly established itself as the industry standard.

DVCS has empowered developers with offline capabilities, faster operations, and flexible collaboration strategies, driving modern development practices globally.
