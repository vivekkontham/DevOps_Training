## What is Source Code Management?

Source Code Management (SCM) is the systematic process of tracking, controlling, and managing changes to software code. It not only enables teams to collaborate seamlessly but also preserves the entire history of a project's evolution. SCM is fundamental for modern software development, ensuring that codebases remain stable, traceable, and adaptable over time.

SCM involves a series of best practices and tools that allow developers to:
- **Track Changes:** Every alteration to the code, along with the author and an accompanying explanation, is recorded. This detailed tracking simplifies debugging and empowers teams to revert to previous stable versions when necessary.
- **Enhance Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on different parts of the code simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s progress. Merging changes and resolving conflicts become efficient and streamlined.
- **Maintain History:** A comprehensive history of changes provides invaluable insights into the project's development, serving as both a record for troubleshooting and a learning resource.
- **Support Rollbacks:** If a newly introduced change causes issues, SCM makes it possible to quickly revert to a previous, working version without dramatic setbacks.


## How Was Source Code Managed Before Modern Version Control Systems

Before dedicated version control systems became the industry standard, managing source code was largely a manual process. Here are the key practices that shaped early SCM approaches:

### Manual File Duplication & Naming Conventions
- **Method:** Developers often saved each iteration of a file as a distinct copy with names like `project_v1`, `project_v2`, etc.
- **Challenge:** While this method captured changes, it became cumbersome and increased the chance for human error. Tracking the evolution of files and identifying which version contained specific modifications was a significant challenge.

### Manual Change Logs
- **Method:** Changes were documented manually in separate text files or logs. This log recorded what had been updated, why the change was made, and who introduced it.
- **Challenge:** Maintaining these logs required extra effort, and discrepancies between the log and actual file changes were common, reducing the reliability of the change history.

### Offline Archives and Physical Printouts
- **Method:** Some developers printed out code or stored codebases on external media for backup purposes.
- **Challenge:** This approach was not only inefficient but also made it difficult to synchronize changes, collaborate with others, or quickly revert to previous versions.

### Early Scripting and Utility Tools
- **Method:** Tools like `diff` and `patch` were used to compare file versions manually and attempt automated merging.
- **Challenge:** Although innovative for their time, these solutions required a deep technical understanding and still left much to be desired when dealing with complex, concurrent changes.

These early practices highlighted the limitations in scalability and reliability, eventually paving the way for the emergence of automated version control systems.
