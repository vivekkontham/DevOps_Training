# Linux For DevOps

## Linux Introduction 

### What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system based on the Unix architecture. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and has since evolved into a powerful and versatile platform used in various environments, from personal computers to servers and embedded systems. The core of Linux is the Linux kernel, which manages hardware resources and provides essential services for software applications.

#### Key Features of Linux:
- **Open Source**: The source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.
- **Multi-user**: Multiple users can access the system simultaneously without interfering with each other.
- **Multitasking**: Linux can run multiple processes at the same time.
- **Portability**: It can run on various hardware platforms, from smartphones to supercomputers.
- **Security**: Linux has robust security features, including user permissions and access controls.

## Understanding Linux Architecture

Linux architecture can be divided into several layers, each serving a specific purpose. Here’s a breakdown of the main components:

1. **Kernel**:
   - The core component of the operating system.
   - Manages system resources, including CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
   - Handles system calls and provides an interface for user applications.

   **Example**: The Linux kernel is responsible for managing how processes are scheduled and how memory is allocated.

2. **System Libraries**:
   - Collections of functions and routines that applications can use to interact with the kernel.
   - Provide a standard interface for application development.

   **Example**: The GNU C Library (glibc) is a common library used in Linux systems that provides standard C library functions.

3. **System Utilities**:
   - Essential tools and programs that perform basic system functions.
   - Include command-line tools, file management utilities, and system monitoring tools.

   **Example**: Commands like `ls`, `cp`, and `mv` are utilities that help users manage files and directories.

4. **User Space**:
   - The environment where user applications run, separate from the kernel.
   - Includes graphical user interfaces (GUIs), command-line interfaces (CLIs), and user applications.

   **Example**: Desktop environments like GNOME or KDE provide a graphical interface for users to interact with the system.

5. **Shell**:
   - A command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system.
   - Interprets user commands and communicates with the kernel.

   **Example**: Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a popular shell used in many Linux distributions.

## Linux vs. Unix: Main Differences

While Linux and Unix share many similarities, they also have key differences. Here’s a comparison:

| Feature                | Linux                                      | Unix                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Source Code**        | Open-source; freely available               | Proprietary; source code is not available |
| **Cost**               | Free to use and distribute                  | Often requires a license fee              |
| **Development**        | Community-driven; many distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora) | Developed by specific vendors (e.g., IBM, HP) |
| **User Interface**     | Various GUIs and command-line interfaces    | Typically command-line based, with some GUIs |
| **File System**        | Supports various file systems (ext4, XFS)  | Traditionally uses UFS or other proprietary file systems |
| **Hardware Support**   | Wide range of hardware support               | Limited to specific hardware configurations |
| **Usage**              | Popular in servers, desktops, and embedded systems | Common in enterprise environments and servers |

## Linux File System
# Linux File System

The Linux file system is a hierarchical structure that organizes and manages files and directories on a Linux operating system. Understanding the Linux file system is essential for users, system administrators, and developers, as it affects how data is stored, accessed, and managed.

## Key Concepts of the Linux File System

### 1. **File System Hierarchy**
The Linux file system follows a standard directory structure known as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). This structure is organized in a tree-like format, with the root directory (`/`) at the top. Below are some of the key directories in the Linux file system:

- **`/` (Root Directory)**: The top-level directory of the file system. All other directories are subdirectories of the root.
  
- **`/bin`**: Contains essential binary executables (commands) that are required for system booting and basic operations. Example: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`.

- **`/sbin`**: Similar to `/bin`, but contains system binaries that are primarily used by the system administrator. Example: `shutdown`, `reboot`.

- **`/etc`**: Contains configuration files for the system and installed applications. Example: `/etc/passwd` (user account information), `/etc/fstab` (file system mount points).

- **`/dev`**: Contains device files that represent hardware devices. Example: `/dev/sda` (first hard disk), `/dev/tty` (terminal devices).

- **`/proc`**: A virtual filesystem that provides information about system processes and kernel parameters. Example: `/proc/cpuinfo` (CPU information), `/proc/meminfo` (memory usage).

- **`/var`**: Contains variable data files, such as logs, databases, and spool files. Example: `/var/log/syslog` (system log), `/var/spool/mail` (user mail).

- **`/home`**: Contains user home directories. Each user has a subdirectory under `/home` where personal files and configurations are stored. Example: `/home/john` for user "john".

- **`/tmp`**: A temporary directory for storing temporary files created by applications. Files in this directory may be deleted on system reboot.

## Linux and Networking Commands

### Top 15 Basic Linux Commands

The `ls` command is used to list files and directories in the current directory. You can use `ls -l` for a detailed list and `ls -a` to include hidden files. The `cd` command changes the current directory. For example, `cd /path/to/directory` changes to the specified path, `cd ..` moves up to the parent directory, and `cd ~` moves to the home directory.

Creating new directories is done with the `mkdir` command. Use `mkdir directory_name` to create a new directory and `mkdir -p path/to/directory` to create nested directories if they don't exist. To remove files and directories, the `rm` command is used. `rm file_name` removes a file, `rm -r directory_name` removes a directory and its contents recursively, and `rm -f file_name` forces removal without prompting.

Copying files and directories is done with the `cp` command. `cp source_file destination_file` copies a file, and `cp -r source_directory destination_directory` copies a directory recursively. The `mv` command moves or renames files and directories. Use `mv source_file destination_file` to move or rename a file, and `mv source_directory destination_directory` to move or rename a directory.

The `grep` command searches for a specific pattern in files or output. Use `grep pattern file_name` to search in a file, `grep -r pattern directory` to search recursively in a directory, and `command | grep pattern` to filter command output. The `ps` command lists running processes. `ps` lists processes for the current user, `ps -ef` lists all running processes, and `ps -eaf` provides full details.

For real-time system information and process lists, the `top` command is used. It displays CPU usage, memory usage, and processes. Press `q` to exit. The `tail` command outputs the last part of a file. Use `tail file_name` to display the last 10 lines, `tail -n N file_name` for the last N lines, and `tail -f file_name` to continuously output new lines.

The `cat` command concatenates and displays file content. Use `cat file_name` to display a file's content. The `vi` command opens a file in the vi editor for editing, while the `nano` command opens a file in the nano editor. The `touch` command creates an empty file or updates timestamps on existing files. Use `touch file_name` to create an empty file. The `echo` command displays a line of text or string passed as an argument. For example, `echo "Hello, World!"`.

## Linux Package Managment 

Package management is a crucial aspect of Linux operating systems, allowing users to install, update, remove, and manage software applications and libraries efficiently. Each Linux distribution typically comes with its own package management system, which simplifies the process of handling software packages.

## Key Concepts of Linux Package Management

### 1. **What is a Package?**
A package is a compressed file that contains software applications, libraries, and metadata about the software, such as its version, dependencies, and installation instructions. Packages are typically distributed in a specific format depending on the package management system used by the Linux distribution.

### 2. **Package Management Systems**
Different Linux distributions use different package management systems. The two most common types are:

- **Debian-based Systems**: Use the Advanced Package Tool (APT) and `.deb` packages.
- **Red Hat-based Systems**: Use the Yellowdog Updater, Modified (YUM) or DNF (Dandified YUM) and `.rpm` packages.

### 3. **Common Package Formats**
- **.deb**: The package format used by Debian and its derivatives (e.g., Ubuntu).
- **.rpm**: The package format used by Red Hat and its derivatives (e.g., CentOS, Fedora).

## Package Management Commands

### A. **Debian-based Systems (APT)**

APT is a powerful command-line tool for managing packages in Debian-based distributions. Here are some common APT commands:

1. **Update Package Index**
   - Command: `sudo apt update`
   - Description: Updates the local package index with the latest information from the repositories.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Upgrade Installed Packages**
   - Command: `sudo apt upgrade`
   - Description: Upgrades all installed packages to their latest versions.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

3. **Install a Package**
   - Command: `sudo apt install <package_name>`
   - Description: Installs a specified package.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install vim
   ```

4. **Remove a Package**
   - Command: `sudo apt remove <package_name>`
   - Description: Removes a specified package but keeps its configuration files.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt remove vim
   ```

5. **Purge a Package**
   - Command: `sudo apt purge <package_name>`
   - Description: Removes a specified package along with its configuration files.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt purge vim
   ```

6. **Search for a Package**
   - Command: `apt search <package_name>`
   - Description: Searches for a package in the repositories.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   apt search git
   ```

### B. **Red Hat-based Systems (YUM/DNF)**

YUM and DNF are package management tools used in Red Hat-based distributions. DNF is the next-generation version of YUM and is the default in newer versions of Fedora and CentOS.

1. **Update Package Index**
   - Command: `sudo dnf check-update` (or `sudo yum check-update`)
   - Description: Checks for available updates for installed packages.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf check-update
   ```

2. **Upgrade Installed Packages**
   - Command: `sudo dnf upgrade` (or `sudo yum update`)
   - Description: Upgrades all installed packages to their latest versions.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf upgrade
   ```

   - Description: Searches for a package in the repositories.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   dnf search git
   ```

### 4. **Package Repositories**
A package repository is a storage location from which software packages can be retrieved and installed. Repositories can be official (maintained by the distribution) or third-party (maintained by external developers).

- **Example**: Ubuntu has official repositories like `main`, `universe`, and `restricted`, which contain different categories of software.
### 5. **Dependency Management**
One of the key features of package management systems is their ability to handle dependencies. Dependencies are other software packages that a program requires to function correctly. When you install a package, the package manager automatically resolves and installs any required dependencies.

- **Example**: If you try to install a software package that requires a specific library, the package manager will automatically download and install that library if it is not already present on your system.

### 6. **Handling Conflicts**
Package managers also manage conflicts that may arise when two packages require different versions of the same dependency or when a package conflicts with another package. The package manager will alert you to these conflicts and may provide options to resolve them.

- **Example**: If you attempt to install a package that conflicts with an already installed package, the package manager may suggest removing the conflicting package or provide options to proceed with the installation.

## Linux File Permisson 
# Linux File Permissions: User & Group Management

Understanding file permissions and user/group management in Linux is essential for maintaining system security and ensuring that users have the appropriate access to files and directories. This guide provides a detailed explanation of how file permissions work in Linux, along with relevant examples.

## Key Concepts of Linux File Permissions

### 1. **File Permissions Overview**
In Linux, every file and directory has associated permissions that determine who can read, write, or execute them. Permissions are divided into three categories:

- **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
- **Group**: A group of users that have shared access to the file.
- **Others**: All other users on the system.

### 2. **Types of Permissions**
There are three types of permissions that can be assigned to files and directories:

- **Read (`r`)**: Permission to read the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory.
- **Write (`w`)**: Permission to modify the contents of a file or add/remove files in a directory.
- **Execute (`x`)**: Permission to execute a file (if it is a program) or access a directory.

### 3. **Understanding Permission Representation**
File permissions are represented in two ways: symbolic notation and numeric (octal) notation.

#### A. **Symbolic Notation**
Permissions are displayed in a string format when using the `ls -l` command. The first character indicates the type of file, followed by three sets of permissions for the owner, group, and others.

- **Example**:
```
-rwxr-xr-- 1 john users 12345 Jan 1 12:00 example.txt
```
- Breakdown:
  - `-`: Indicates a regular file (a `d` would indicate a directory).
  - `rwx`: Owner (john) has read, write, and execute permissions.
  - `r-x`: Group (users) has read and execute permissions.
  - `r--`: Others have read permissions only.

#### B. **Numeric (Octal) Notation**
Permissions can also be represented using octal numbers, where each permission type is assigned a value:
- Read (`r`) = 4
- Write (`w`) = 2
- Execute (`x`) = 1

The values are summed for each category:
- Owner: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 (rwx)
- Group: 4 + 0 + 1 = 5 (r-x)
- Others: 4 + 0 + 0 = 4 (r--)

In this case, the numeric representation would be `754`.

### 4. **Changing Permissions**
The `chmod` command is used to change file permissions. You can use either symbolic or numeric notation.

#### A. **Using Symbolic Notation**
- **Command**: `chmod [who][operation][permissions] <file>`
  - **who**: `u` (user/owner), `g` (group), `o` (others), `a` (all)
  - **operation**: `+` (add), `-` (remove), `=` (set exact permissions)
  - **permissions**: `r`, `w`, `x`

**Example**: To add execute permission for the owner:
```bash
chmod u+x example.txt
```

**Example**: To remove write permission for the group:
```bash
chmod g-w example.txt
```

#### B. **Using Numeric Notation**
- **Command**: `chmod <numeric_value> <file>`

**Example**: To set permissions to `rwxr-xr--` (754):
```bash
chmod 754 example.txt
```

### 5. **Changing Ownership**
The `chown` command is used to change the owner and/or group of a file or directory.

- **Command**: `chown [new_owner]:[new_group] <file>`

**Example**: To change the owner to `alice` and the group to `developers`:
```bash
chown alice:developers example.txt
```

### 6. **Managing Groups**
Groups are used to manage permissions for multiple users. Users can be added to or removed from groups using the `usermod` command.

- **Adding a User to a Group**:
  - **Command**: `sudo usermod -aG <group> <user>`

**Example**: To add user `john` to the `developers` group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG developers john
```

- **Removing a User from a Group**:
  - **Command**: `sudo gpasswd -d <user> <group>`

**Example**: To remove user `john` from the `developers` group:
```bash
sudo gpasswd -d john developers
```
### 7. **Viewing Permissions and Ownership**
To view the permissions and ownership of files and directories, you can use the `ls -l` command. This command lists files in the current directory along with their permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and modification date.

**Example**:
```bash
ls -l
```
Output:
```
total 12
-rwxr-xr-- 1 john users 12345 Jan 1 12:00 example.txt
drwxr-xr-x 2 alice developers 4096 Jan 1 12:00 project
