# Introduction to Computer Networking

# Importance of Computer Networking

## Communication
"One of the primary functions of networking is to enable various forms of communication. In today’s fast-paced world, effective communication is essential for success."

### Example
"Consider how teams collaborate using tools like Zoom or Slack. These platforms rely on networking to function, allowing team members to communicate in real-time, share files, and hold virtual meetings regardless of their physical location. For instance, a marketing team spread across different cities can brainstorm ideas and finalize projects without ever meeting in person, thanks to networking."

## Resource Sharing
"Networking also allows multiple users to access shared resources, which can significantly enhance productivity and efficiency."

### Example
"In an office environment, several employees can print documents to a single printer connected to the network. This not only saves costs on hardware but also simplifies management. Imagine a scenario where a team is working on a presentation; they can all print their slides to the same printer, ensuring consistency and saving time."

## Internet Access
"Another critical aspect of networking is that it connects devices to the internet, providing access to a vast array of information and services."

### Example
"When you browse the web on your smartphone, it’s using a network to connect to the internet. This connection allows you to access social media, research information, shop online, and much more. For instance, when you search for a recipe on Google, your device sends a request over the network, retrieves the information from a server, and displays it on your screen—all in a matter of seconds."

## Real-World Impact
"The importance of networking extends beyond just convenience. In healthcare, for example, networking allows doctors to access patient records from different locations, improving the quality of care. In education, students can attend online classes and access resources from anywhere, breaking down geographical barriers."

# Types of Networks

## Local Area Network (LAN)
"A Local Area Network, or LAN, connects computers within a limited area, such as a home, school, or office."

### Example
"Your home Wi-Fi network is a LAN that connects your laptop, smartphone, and smart TV. This allows you to stream videos, play games, and browse the internet simultaneously without any issues."

## Wide Area Network (WAN)
"A Wide Area Network, or WAN, covers a broad area, often connecting multiple LANs."

### Example
"The internet itself is the largest WAN, linking millions of networks worldwide. For businesses with multiple locations, a WAN allows them to connect their offices, enabling employees to share information and collaborate effectively."

## Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
"A Metropolitan Area Network, or MAN, spans a city or a large campus."

### Example
"A city’s public Wi-Fi network that provides internet access across various locations, such as parks and libraries, is an example of a MAN. This type of network enhances connectivity for residents and visitors alike."

## Personal Area Network (PAN)
"A Personal Area Network, or PAN, is a small network, typically within a range of a few meters."

### Example
"Bluetooth connections between your smartphone and wireless headphones form a PAN. This allows you to listen to music or take calls without being physically tethered to your device."

# Key Networking Devices

## Introduction to Networking Devices
"In this segment, we will explore some essential networking devices that play crucial roles in connecting computers and facilitating communication within networks. Understanding these devices will help you appreciate how data travels and how networks operate."

### 1. Switch
**Definition:**  
"A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices within a Local Area Network (LAN) and manages data traffic efficiently."

**Functionality:**  
"Switches operate at the data link layer of the OSI model and use MAC addresses to forward data only to the intended recipient, reducing unnecessary traffic."

**Example:**  
"In an office environment, a switch connects several computers, printers, and servers. For instance, if one employee sends a document to the printer, the switch ensures that the data reaches the printer without delay, allowing for smooth operations. This targeted data transmission improves network efficiency."

### 2. Router
**Definition:**  
"A router is a device that connects different networks and directs data traffic between them."

**Functionality:**  
"Routers operate at the network layer of the OSI model and use IP addresses to determine the best path for data to travel across networks."

**Example:**  
"In your home, the router connects your local network to the internet. When you stream a video, the router directs the incoming data packets to your device while managing outgoing requests. For example, if you’re watching a movie on Netflix, the router ensures that the data flows smoothly from the internet to your device, allowing for uninterrupted viewing."

### 3. Modem
**Definition:**  
"A modem (short for modulator-demodulator) is a device that enables computers to communicate over telephone lines, cable systems, or other types of data transmission networks."

**Functionality:**  
"Modems modulate and demodulate signals, allowing digital devices to communicate over analog communication lines."

**Example:**  
"A DSL modem connects your home network to your internet service provider. When you access a website, the modem translates your request into a signal that can travel over the internet, and then it converts the incoming data back into digital format for your device. For instance, when you send an email, the modem ensures that your message reaches the recipient by converting it into a suitable format for transmission."

### 4. Hub
**Definition:**  
"A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple Ethernet devices, making them act as a single network segment."

**Functionality:**  
"Hubs operate at the physical layer of the OSI model and broadcast incoming data packets to all connected devices, regardless of the intended recipient."

**Example:**  
"In a small office setup, a hub can connect several computers. However, because it sends data to all devices, it can lead to network congestion. For example, if one computer sends a file to another, all other computers connected to the hub will also receive that data, which can slow down the network. This is why hubs are less common today, as switches provide more efficient data handling."

### 5. Network Interface Card (NIC)
**Definition:**  
"A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that allows a computer or device to connect to a network."

**Functionality:**  
"NICs can be wired or wireless and are responsible for converting data into a format suitable for transmission over the network."

**Example:**  
"Every computer has a NIC, whether it’s a built-in Ethernet port for wired connections or a wireless adapter for Wi-Fi. For instance, when you connect your laptop to a Wi-Fi network, the wireless NIC enables your device to communicate with the router, allowing you to access the internet."

### 6. Bridge
**Definition:**  
"A bridge is a networking device that connects two or more network segments, allowing them to function as a single network."

**Functionality:**  
"Bridges operate at the data link layer of the OSI model and use MAC addresses to filter traffic, reducing collisions and improving network performance."

**Example:**  
"In a large office building, a bridge can connect two separate LANs on different floors. For example, if the marketing department is on one floor and the sales department is on another, a bridge can facilitate communication between the two departments, allowing them to share resources and collaborate effectively."


## What is a Protocol?

### Definition
A protocol in computer networking is a set of rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted and received over a network. Protocols define the format, timing, sequencing, and error-checking mechanisms for data exchange, ensuring that devices can communicate effectively.

### Importance of Protocols
Protocols are essential for enabling interoperability between different devices and systems. They ensure that data is sent and received accurately, regardless of the hardware or software being used. Without protocols, communication between devices would be chaotic and unreliable.

### Examples of Common Protocols
1. **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: A connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission by establishing a connection before data transfer and confirming receipt of packets.
2. **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: A connectionless protocol that allows for faster data transmission without the overhead of establishing a connection or confirming receipt, making it suitable for applications like video streaming and online gaming.
3. **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: The foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web, used for transferring web pages and resources.
4. **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**: A standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server on a computer network.

## IP Address and Types of IP Addresses

### Definition
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the device in the network.

### Types of IP Addresses
1. **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**: The most widely used version of IP addresses, consisting of 32 bits, typically represented in decimal format as four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1). IPv4 can support approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.

2. **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**: The successor to IPv4, designed to address the limitations of IPv4, particularly the shortage of available addresses. IPv6 uses 128 bits, allowing for a vastly larger address space (approximately 340 undecillion addresses). IPv6 addresses are represented in hexadecimal format, separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

### Example of IP Addresses
- **IPv4 Example**: `192.168.0.1`
- **IPv6 Example**: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

---

## IP Address Classes (IPv4 & IPv6)

### IPv4 Address Classes
IPv4 addresses are divided into five classes (A, B, C, D, and E) based on their leading bits and intended use:

1. **Class A**:
   - **Range**: 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
   - **Leading Bits**: 0
   - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.0.0.0
   - **Usage**: Designed for large networks (e.g., multinational corporations).
   - **Example**: `10.0.0.1`

2. **Class B**:
   - **Range**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
   - **Leading Bits**: 10
   - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.255.0.0
   - **Usage**: Suitable for medium-sized networks (e.g., universities).
   - **Example**: `172.16.0.1`

3. **Class C**:
   - **Range**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
   - **Leading Bits**: 110
   - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0
   - **Usage**: Commonly used for small networks (e.g., small businesses).
   - **Example**: `192.168.1.1`

4. **Class D**:
   - **Range**: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
   - **Leading Bits**: 1110
   - **Usage**: Reserved for multicast groups.
   - **Example**: `224.0.0.1`

5. **Class E**:
   - **Range**: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
   - **Leading Bits**: 1111
   - **Usage**: Reserved for experimental purposes.
   - **Example**: `250.0.0.1`

## IPv6 Address Classes

IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers written in hexadecimal format, divided into eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). Unlike IPv4, IPv6 does not have classes in the traditional sense, but it does have different types of addresses based on their purpose.

### Unicast

Unicast addresses are used to identify a single unique interface on a network. They are the most common type of IPv6 address.

**Example**: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

### Multicast

Multicast addresses are used to send packets to multiple interfaces. They are similar to Class D addresses in IPv4.

**Example**: ff02::1

### Anycast

Anycast addresses are assigned to multiple interfaces, but packets sent to an anycast address are delivered to the nearest interface based on routing distance.

**Example**: 2001:0db8:85a3::1

### Link-Local

Link-local addresses are used for communication within a single network segment. They are automatically configured and are not routable on the internet.

**Example**: fe80::1a2b:3c4d:5e6f:7g8h

### Global Unicast

Global unicast addresses are routable on the internet and are equivalent to public IPv4 addresses.

**Example**: 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334


## Loopback

### Definition

The loopback address is a special IP address that is used to test network software without physically transmitting packets over a network. It allows a device to communicate with itself, which is useful for troubleshooting and testing.

### IPv4 Loopback Address

In IPv4, the loopback address is defined as **127.0.0.1**. The entire range from **127.0.0.0** to **127.255.255.255** is reserved for loopback purposes, but **127.0.0.1** is the most commonly used address.

**Example**: 
- To test the loopback interface, you can use the command:
  ```bash
  ping 127.0.0.1
  ```

### IPv6 Loopback Address

In IPv6, the loopback address is represented as **::1**. This address serves the same purpose as the IPv4 loopback address.

**Example**:
- To test the loopback interface in IPv6, you can use the command:
  ```bash
  ping ::1
  ```

### Purpose

- **Testing**: Loopback addresses are primarily used for testing network applications and services.
- **Troubleshooting**: They help diagnose issues with network configurations and software without involving external networks.

## Subnetting

### Definition

Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets). This improves network performance and security by reducing broadcast domains and allowing for better organization of IP addresses.

### Subnetting in IPv4

In IPv4, subnetting involves borrowing bits from the host portion of an IP address to create additional network addresses. The subnet mask determines which part of the IP address is the network and which part is the host.

#### Example

Consider the IP address **192.168.1.0** with a default subnet mask of **255.255.255.0** (or /24). This allows for 256 addresses (0-255), with 254 usable for hosts.

If we want to create 4 subnets, we can borrow 2 bits from the host portion:

- **New Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.192 (or /26)
- **Subnets**:
  - 192.168.1.0/26 (Hosts: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.62)
  - 192.168.1.64/26 (Hosts: 192.168.1.65 to 192.168.1.126)
  - 192.168.1.128/26 (Hosts: 192.168.1.129 to 192.168.1.190)
  - 192.168.1.192/26 (Hosts: 192.168.1.193 to 192.168.1.254)

### Subnetting in IPv6

In IPv6, subnetting is less common due to the vast address space, but it can still be done by dividing the address into subnets using the prefix length.

#### Example

Consider the IPv6 address **2001:0db8:85a3::/64**. This allows for a large number of subnets.

If we want to create 4 subnets, we can use a /66 prefix:

- **Subnets**:
  - 2001:0db8:85a3:0000::/66
  - 2001:0db8:85a3:0001::/66
  - 2001:0db8:85a3:0002::/66
  - 2001:0db8:85a3:0003::/66

### Purpose

- **Efficient IP Address Management**: Subnetting allows for better allocation of IP addresses based on the size of the network.
- **Improved Security**: By isolating subnets, organizations can enhance security and control traffic flow.
- **Reduced Broadcast Traffic**: Smaller subnets reduce the amount of broadcast traffic, improving overall network performance.

## Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)

### Definition

CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets. It replaces the traditional class-based system (Class A, B, C) with a more flexible and efficient way to manage IP address space.

### CIDR Notation

CIDR notation combines the IP address with a suffix that indicates the number of bits in the network prefix. For example, **192.168.1.0/24** indicates that the first 24 bits are used for the network portion, leaving the remaining bits for host addresses.

### Benefits of CIDR

1. **Efficient Use of IP Address Space**: CIDR allows for variable-length subnet masking (VLSM), which means that networks can be allocated only the number of addresses they need, rather than being forced into fixed class sizes. This helps to conserve IP address space.

2. **Simplified Routing**: CIDR enables route aggregation (also known as supernetting), which allows multiple IP addresses to be represented as a single routing entry. This reduces the size of routing tables and improves routing efficiency.

3. **Flexibility**: CIDR provides greater flexibility in designing networks, allowing for more granular control over how IP addresses are allocated and managed.

### Example of CIDR

Consider the following CIDR allocations:

- **192.168.0.0/22**: This allocation provides 1024 IP addresses (from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.3.255), which can be used for a medium-sized network.
- **10.0.0.0/8**: This allocation provides 16,777,216 IP addresses, suitable for a large organization or ISP.
- **172.16.0.0/12**: This allocation provides 1,048,576 IP addresses, often used for private networks.

### CIDR and Subnetting

CIDR is closely related to subnetting, as both concepts involve dividing IP address space into smaller segments. However, CIDR allows for more flexibility in the size of these segments compared to traditional subnetting methods.

For example, if an organization has a CIDR block of **192.168.0.0/22**, it can create subnets of various sizes based on its needs:

- **192.168.0.0/24**: 256 addresses
- **192.168.1.0/25**: 128 addresses
- **192.168.2.0/26**: 64 addresses

## Network Models


### 1. OSI and TCP/IP Models

# OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network protocols in seven layers. Each layer serves a specific function and communicates with the layers directly above and below it.

## Layers of the OSI Model

1. **Physical Layer**: 
   - Responsible for the physical connection between devices.
   - Examples: Cables, switches, and network interface cards (NICs).

2. **Data Link Layer**: 
   - Provides node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction.
   - Examples: Ethernet, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol).

3. **Network Layer**: 
   - Manages device addressing and determines the best path for data transfer.
   - Examples: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).

4. **Transport Layer**: 
   - Ensures complete data transfer and error recovery.
   - Examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

5. **Session Layer**: 
   - Manages sessions between applications.
   - Examples: APIs, sockets.

6. **Presentation Layer**: 
   - Translates data between the application layer and the network.
   - Examples: Encryption, compression.

7. **Application Layer**: 
   - Closest to the end user, it interacts with software applications.
   - Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP.

## Example
When you send an email:
- The application layer (SMTP) prepares the email.
- The transport layer (TCP) ensures it is sent reliably.
- The network layer (IP) routes it to the recipient's server.
- The data link and physical layers handle the actual transmission over the network.
```

# TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is a more simplified framework than the OSI model, consisting of four layers.

## Layers of the TCP/IP Model

1. **Link Layer**: 
   - Corresponds to the OSI's Physical and Data Link layers.
   - Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.

2. **Internet Layer**: 
   - Corresponds to the OSI's Network layer.
   - Responsible for addressing and routing.
   - Example: IP.

3. **Transport Layer**: 
   - Corresponds to the OSI's Transport layer.
   - Ensures reliable or unreliable delivery.
   - Examples: TCP, UDP.

4. **Application Layer**: 
   - Corresponds to the OSI's Session, Presentation, and Application layers.
   - Interfaces with end-user applications.
   - Examples: HTTP, FTP, DNS.

## Example
When you access a website:
- The application layer (HTTP) sends a request.
- The transport layer (TCP) ensures the request is sent reliably.
- The internet layer (IP) routes the request to the web server.
- The link layer transmits the data over the network.
```

### 2. Domain Name System (DNS)

# Domain Name System (DNS)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

## How DNS Works

1. **Domain Name Resolution**:
   - When a user types a URL in a browser, a DNS query is initiated.
   - The query is sent to a DNS resolver, which is usually provided by the user's ISP.

2. **Query Process**:
   - The resolver checks its cache for the IP address.
   - If not found, it queries a root DNS server.
   - The root server directs the resolver to a TLD (Top-Level Domain) server (e.g., .com, .org).
   - The TLD server points to the authoritative DNS server for the specific domain.

3. **Response**:
   - The authoritative DNS server responds with the IP address.
   - The resolver caches the response for future queries and returns the IP address to the user's browser.

## Example
- User types `www.example.com`.
- DNS resolver queries the root server, which points to the `.com` TLD server.
- The TLD server points to the authoritative server for `example.com`, which returns



### 1. Encryption


# Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. This means that both the sender and the receiver must have access to the secret key.

## Characteristics
- **Key Management**: The key must be kept secret and shared securely between parties.
- **Speed**: Generally faster than asymmetric encryption due to simpler algorithms.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for encrypting large amounts of data.

## Common Algorithms
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Widely used for securing data.
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: An older standard, now considered insecure.
- **3DES (Triple DES)**: An enhancement of DES, applying the algorithm three times.

## Example
```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad
import os

# Key and data
key = os.urandom(16)  # AES key must be either 16, 24, or 32 bytes long
data = b"Secret Message"

# Encrypt
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)
ct_bytes = cipher.encrypt(pad(data, AES.block_size))
iv = cipher.iv

# Decrypt
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
pt = unpad(cipher.decrypt(ct_bytes), AES.block_size)

print("Ciphertext:", ct_bytes)
print("Plaintext:", pt)
```
```

# Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This allows secure communication without the need to share a secret key.

## Characteristics
- **Key Pair**: One key is public and can be shared openly, while the other is private and must be kept secret.
- **Security**: More secure for key exchange and digital signatures.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for secure communications, digital signatures, and key exchange.

## Common Algorithms
- **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**: One of the first public-key cryptosystems.
- **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**: Offers similar security with smaller key sizes.

## Example
```python
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
import base64

# Generate key pair
key = RSA.generate(2048)
private_key = key.export_key()
public_key = key.publickey().export_key()

# Encrypt
cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(RSA.import_key(public_key))
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(b"Secret Message")

# Decrypt
cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(RSA.import_key(private_key))
plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)

print("Ciphertext:", base64.b64encode(ciphertext))
print("Plaintext:", plaintext)
```
```

### 2. Hashing

# Hashing

Hashing is a process that transforms input data of any size into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a digest that uniquely represents the data. Hash functions are commonly used in various applications, including data integrity verification and password storage.

## Characteristics
- **Deterministic**: The same input will always produce the same hash output.
- **Fixed Size**: Regardless of the input size, the output is always of a fixed length.
- **One-Way**: Hashing is a one-way function; it cannot be reversed to retrieve the original input.

## Common Hash Functions
- **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**: Fast but not secure against collisions.
- **SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)**: More secure than MD5 but still vulnerable to attacks.
- **SHA-256**: Part of the SHA-2 family, widely used and considered secure.

## Example
```python
import hashlib

# Input data
data = b"Hello, World!"

# Hashing using SHA-256
hash_object = hashlib.sha256(data)
hex_dig = hash_object.hexdigest()

print("SHA-256 Hash:", hex_d)

# On a Cisco router
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1
```

### 3.4 Example of Dynamic Routing (OSPF)
```bash
# On a Cisco router
router ospf 1
network 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
```

## 4. Virtual Private Networks (VPN)

### 4.1 What is a VPN?

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. It allows users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to a private network.

### 4.2 Types of VPN

- **Remote Access VPN**: Allows individual users to connect to a private network from a remote location.
- **Site-to-Site VPN**: Connects entire networks to each other, such as connecting a branch office to a corporate network.

### 4.3 Example of Setting Up a VPN (OpenVPN)
1. **Install OpenVPN** on the server and client machines.
2. **Configure the server** with a configuration file specifying the network settings.
3. **Generate keys and certificates** for secure communication.
4. **Connect the client** using the OpenVPN client with the server's configuration.

```bash
# Example command to start OpenVPN client
openvpn --config client.ovpn
```
